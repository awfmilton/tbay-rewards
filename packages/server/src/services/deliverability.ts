 * sending domain's reputation intact — a few hundred hard bounces is enough
 * for a provider to start filing everything from that domain as spam.
 *
 * Suppression is keyed on the address, not the contact. A dead mailbox is a
 * fact about the mailbox, and it must survive the contact being deleted,
 * re-imported, or existing twice under different external references.
